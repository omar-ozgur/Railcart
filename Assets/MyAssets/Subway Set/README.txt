Subway level kit

- Rotate tunnel pieces in 45 degree increments so that they snap nicely. The bending is made in 45 degrees so you have to rotate accordingly.
- Use vertex snap (moving gizmo active --> hold 'v' and drag from vertex) to snap tunnel pieces from the lower corners.
- Tunnel1_DIF texture sheet has all the tunnels, plus all the small stuff included.
- Entrance in it's own sheet.
- In the 'no rails' folders you can find the tunnel pieces stripped bare. If you want tunnels with no rails, look there. Also prefab folder has 'no rails' folder. 
- tunnel pieces are one-sided. If a need arises for pieces with thickness/shell, e-mail me and I'll make it happen.
- Example level was made with pro-trial, so if you have free version, the lighting in the example scene will be dull.
